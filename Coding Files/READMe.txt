##This code has been written for the processing of unassigned peptides from Mascot Data

##USERS MUST:
	>> create their own personal folder in whichever location they wish to store their data (henceforth referred to as "Results folder"
	>> copy (DO NOT CUT) the following python files into this results folder:
		>> BLAST.py
		>>main.py
		>> HSPClass.py
		>>peptideClass.py
	>> have a copy of a suitably formatted file (as per Code for Post-mass spec analysis.ppt located in \\isd.ad.flinders.edu.au\Research\CMPH-Chew Worm Lab\Post Mass Spec Analysis Code)
	

##USERS should be aware that running this code successfully will generate multiple files; it is recommended to have 1 folder per file being analysed.
